![Our UPLIFT! event raised $105K to support the open source ecosystem]({{ site.url }}/images/uplift-1.png)

Collaboration is at the heart of open source. One person gives voice to a need; others join in chorus and quickly an idea becomes a project...and a community.

**We have always been in this together.**

So I want to tell you the story of [FOSS Responders](https://fossresponders.com/) and our UPLIFT! event, both designed to support open source projects already feeling the economic fallout from COVID-19. We chapter this story in the quantitation of metrics, but fundamentally it is  a story of impact that goes far beyond numbers. It is _our_ story of sustaining open source communities ‚Äì people with hearts and minds ‚Äì during an unprecedented time of disruption and change.

Once upon a (real)time‚Ä¶ there was **[1 tweet](https://twitter.com/DuaneOBrien/status/1235389692612231168)** a mere **4 months** ago (remember (March?) asking how others of open source were doing in the disruptions of COVID-19. All around us we could see unparalleled unemployment rates and economic contraction and knew that open source was not immune to their effects. In response, **99 volunteers** rallied to tackle these challenges to our ecosystem.

A world without the innovation of open source is not a world we will ever accept. Together, we rallied to support our peers with an online funding event. Aptly named [UPLIFT!](https://opencollective.com/foss-responders/events/virtual-funding-event-q2-2020-4edd1e3a), the goal was to **lift up** open source organizations hit hard because of event cancellations, disappearing sponsorship opportunities and their usual ways of fundraising with their communities during the COVID-19 crisis.

With the support of **10 corporate partners** and **22 individual donations** (thank you!), we were able to raise **$105,000USD** for **10 open source organizations**. The organizations FOSS Responders was able to uplift are; [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/), [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association), [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/), [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/), [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/), [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/), [Open Source Matters Inc.](https://www.opensourcematters.org/), [Plain Schwarz/Berlin Buzzwords](https://plainschwarz.com/), [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/), and [the Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/). Together, these organizations represent **1000s of open source contributors** and **100s of employees**.

Like the open source ecosystem and technology engineering itself, UPLIFT! was an event of innovation. To pull together and run the event, we used **9 platforms** (Zoom, Jitsi, Etherpad, Google Docs, Slack, Signal, Open Collective, Twitter and good ol‚Äô email) to showcase these 10 amazing teams. **Eighty-nine attendees** joined to discuss critical open source sustainability, representing **9 countries** (and at least 7 timezones!).

Some topics were serious. Others were fun. Serious discussions included ‚ÄòHow to best fund the  FOSS organisations‚Äô, ‚ÄòHow to move and run events online and best practices‚Äô, and ‚ÄòHow to involve workplaces in FOSS organisations and projects.‚Äô The fun ones ranged in absurdity including: **1 unicorn hat**, **1 Happy Birthday** by 55 Zoom atonal voices, and **countless laughs**.

We also have **countless people to thank**.

We want to thank our amazing Partners: the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://opencollective.com/sloan-foundation), [DigitalOcean](https://opencollective.com/digitalocean), [GitHub](https://opencollective.com/github), [Google Open Source](https://opencollective.com/google), [Indeed](https://opencollective.com/indeed), Linux Fund, [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/opencollectiveinc), [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource), [Sentry.io](https://opencollective.com/sentry), and [the Ethereum Foundation](https://opencollective.com/ef_esp) for their generous support of the open source ecosystem.

We would also like to thank the **10 organizations** for all that they do and for joining us in showcasing open source resiliency.  We would also like to thank our **10 room hosts** and **10 reviewers** whose generosity of spirit facilitated these dialogues of open source support. And we would like to thank our **89 attendees** that helped us tackle economic contraction for our open source reality.

It will take courage and commitment to continue to build a resilient open source community that can weather these unplanned events. We need each other and we need to work together.
