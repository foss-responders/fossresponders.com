As we close off this first phase, we wanted to tell you the story of how [FOSS Responders](https://fossresponders.com/) became to exist and its journey so far.  While we are using the quantitation of metrics, it is also a story of impact that goes far beyond numbers.  It is _our_ story of sustaining open source communities – people with hearts and minds – during an unprecedented time of disruption and change.

So, once upon a (real)time:

FOSS Responders started through **1 tweet** a mere **4 months** ago (remember (March?), and it saw **99 volunteers** convene to address the economic fallout facing open source during COVID-19. All around us we could see unparalleled unemployment rates and economic contraction and knew that open source was not immune to their effects.

A world without the innovation of open source is not a world we will ever accept.

FOSS Responders is **a team of unique multitudes** – corporate open source leaders, startup designers, open source maintainers, and open source foundation executives, and more. Together, we rallied to support our peers with an online funding event. Aptly named UPLIFT!, the goal was to lift up open source organizations hit hard because of event cancellations, disappearing sponsorship opportunities and their usual ways of fundraising with their communities during the COVID-19 crisis.

With the support of  10 corporate partners and 22 individual donations (thank you!), we were able to raise **$105,000** for **10 open source organizations**. The organizations FOSS Responders was able to uplift are; [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/), [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/), [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association), [Plain Schwarz/Berlin Buzzwords](https://plainschwarz.com/), [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/), [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/), [Open Source Matters Inc.](https://www.opensourcematters.org/), [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/), [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) and [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/). Together, these organizations represent **1000s of open source contributors** and **100s of employees**.

We want to lift up more.


TODO Just one screen of the many attendees at our UPLIFT! event

Like the open source ecosystem and technology engineering itself, UPLIFT! was an event of innovation. To pull together and run the event, we used **9 platforms** (Zoom, Jitsi, Etherpad, Google Docs, Slack, Signal, Open Collective, Twitter and good ol’ email) to showcase these 10 amazing teams. **Eighty-nine attendees** joined to discuss critical open source sustainability, representing **9 countries** (and who knows how many time zones).

Some topics were serious. Others were fun. Serious discussions included ‘How to best fund the  FOSS organisations’, ‘How to move and run events online and best practices’, and ‘How to involve workplaces in FOSS organisations and projects.’ The fun ones ranged in absurdity including: **1 unicorn hat**, **1 Happy Birthday** by 55 Zoom atonal voices, and **countless laughs**.

We also have **countless people to thank**.

We want to thank our amazing Partners: the Alfred P, Sloan Foundation, DigitalOcean, GitHub, Google Open Source, Indeed, Linux Fund, Open Collective, Open Source Collective,  Sentry, and The Ethereum Foundation for their generous support of the open source ecosystem.

We would like to thank the **10 organizations** for all that they do and for joining us in showcasing open source resiliency.  We would like to thank our **10 room hosts** whose generosity of spirit facilitated those dialogues of open source seriousness and fun. And we would like to thank our 89 attendees that helped us tackle economic contraction for our open source reality.

It will take courage and commitment to continue to build a resilient open source community that can weather these unplanned events.
