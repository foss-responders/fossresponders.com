## Design files and links

The major bulk of the design mock ups, brand identity and design system are located in this [Adobe XD file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v3VVVtEic4KNNPOb4WWnJkdKd-t_WIRF/view?usp=sharing) [Adobe web link](https://xd.adobe.com/view/8e9576cb-18da-4d9f-58b8-7d00d753377f-f8a4/) (Updated 13.06.2020)

Further design work was done on the blog via [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/eqiXamWjAerrBr4ajtLf5Z/foss-responders?node-id=26%3A132)

The design work was done in collaboration by [Eriol Fox](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign), [Jay Sethi](https://github.com/jaysethi), [Richard Littauer](https://github.com/RichardLitt), [Alyssa Wright]() and [Nuritzi Sanchez]() and [Alison Yu](https://github.com/alisonjudy)

## Design process

Foss responders did not follow any strict methodlogy or process when creating design work and typically 'design briefs' were encompassed in issues. 

Those with design skills did however, make sure to include a wider array of voices, thoughts and opinions across the group and did their best to facilitate an open discussion about visual and design choices.
Several design artifacts were also made using accessible to non-designers tools like [google slides for social media graphics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tx6_4f36vRmwn0mD_RJoYMRt7swv9yzuM7XUH_wEXNM/edit?usp=sharing)
