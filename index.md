## Need help?

COVID-19 is impacting the open source industry in many ways. If you or your community has been impacted, please let us know. We are actively looking for ways to help. Help may come in many forms such as advice on how to cancel and negotiate your event contracts, how to managed digital events, and individual or organizational financial support.

## About

<p class="center"><a href="https://slack.opencollective.com/#crisis-working-group"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-open%20collective-blue" alt="Slack link to Open Collective Slack"/></a></p>

Open source software depends upon real-world interactions just as much as it does on code. With the alarming spread of the Coronavirus, the open source ecosystem is being affected in enormously impactful ways. This site is one of many efforts to help.

It started as an organic movement led by Duane O'Brien (Indeed.com), Megan Byrd-Sanicki (Google), and others. We're open to all who can help out!

## Sponsors and Backers

FOSS Responders is an open source, open project. Anyone can jump in and work on it. It is entirely volunteer run. Right now, we're in particular need of funders, designers, and people to spread the word.

Some of the companies where our volunteers work (but may or may not be representing their company) include:

- [Indeed](https://indeed.com)
- [Maintainer Mountaineer](https://maintainer.io)
- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com)
- ...and yours?

## Other Efforts
